To celebrate finishing my jeans, I bought myself my first garment quantity of Liberty fabric. I figured if I could finish jeans that I'd be willing to wear in public, I could definitely *finally* buy this Liberty print I've been obsessed with since I first saw it. I am just glad they never sold out of it! The print is definitely overwhelming and having it in such a large swath of fabric was a little intimidating but I am glad I went with it.

Project details:

- **Fabric:** Liberty of London, Desert Landscape (Color B, Yellow), purchased at Modern Domestic
- **View:** C (dress)
- **Size:** 10 bust, graded to a size 6 in the waist and 8 in the hips
- **Modifications:** added pockets

I didn't think the print had a right side up, but it turns out that it does! These are teeny tiny camels printed on the fabric.

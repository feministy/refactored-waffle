I made jeans y'all! And they fit! Stupidly well! I attribute the amazing fit of these jeans entirely to the amazing instructor at Modern Domestic who helped me make the following adjustments:

- *very* full calf adjustment
- grading a size 6 waist to a size 10 hip
- adding 1.5" to the back rise

Turns out I have a enormous ass, who knew? *Also* turns out I had been measuring my hips in the wrong spot for years: I was measuring my actual hip instead of the widest point around my butt. The end result is that my hip measurement is a whopping 40" - and I had been thinking it was 36" all this time!

Details:

- **Fabric:** Robert Kaufman Stretch Denim (8.6oz, 4% spandex)
- **View:** High waisted (hell yes)
- **Size:** 6 waist, 10 hip
- **Modifications:** full calf adjustment and 1.5" length added to the back rise, shortened by about 3"

Anyways. I am so ridiculously happy with these jeans! It'll be awhile before I make jeans again, but I am so sold on the concept. I didn't actually own a single pair of jeans before I made these and now I find myself reaching for them regularly. 

I love the super stretchy denim, I don't know how I would feel about having these with less than 4% spandex.

The topstitching on this was a bit of a struggle for me... I am not the most steady handed sewist, but I found that telling myself I had 3 chances to get it right and keeping that 3rd set of stitches *no matter what* helped a lot. I spend about 45 minutes on the fly topstitching and omg never again.

I am absolutely, 100% making these jeans again!

Adjustments I'll make with the next pair:

- grading the waistband closer to a size 4
- take in the knees a little
- take in the ankles *a lot*
- make the calf adjustment a little wider

I was told it takes "8-9 pairs of jeans" to get the perfect fit and that's just fine with me!

I started this pattern in the middle of a class I was taking for the <a href="https://store.closetcasepatterns.com/products/ginger-skinny-jeans-pattern" target="#">Ginger Jeans pattern</a>. I somehow went from never having made a Closet Case Files pattern to absolutely *loving* them! The instructions can be a little pithy, but I absolutely love the detailed sewalong posts that have the expanded instructions. Because I make a lot of different kind of garments, I am not super practiced at things like collars and yokes so the detailed instructions were super helpful for this one.

Project details:

- **Fabric:** Robert Kaufman Chambray, purchased at Modern Domestic
- **View:** C (dress)
- **Size:** 10 bust, graded to a size 6 in the waist and 8 in the hips
- **Modifications:** added pockets, contrast top stitching

I am right on the cusp of needing a full bust adjustment for most patterns, and I decided not to make one for this dress based on the [sizing post](https://closetcasepatterns.com/choosing-a-size-pattern-modifications-full-bust-adjustment/) from the sewalong. One of my chief complaints about RTW garments are that they are too tight in the arms or across the back. Because there was a whopping 7 inches (!!!) of ease in the hips, I used a size 10 for the neck and bust, graded to a size 6 and back out to an 8 for the hips. Taking in the waist was a *great* idea. It makes the silhouette a lot more feminine and a lot less "I am wearing a paper bag".

I had picked up some lovely, simple buttons but then I realized I am not a lovely, simple person and went for the bright coral buttons I bought on an impulse! This is actually the second dress I used these particular buttons on, I used a brown set on a Hawthorn Dress (from Colette Patterns). Because the buttons were so flashy, I went with contrast top stitching: a super bright, basically neon coral for accents throughout. I added a little topstitching that wasn't required to emphasize the contrast a bit more and I love it.

I didn't make any changes to the length, but I probably will shorten this by about 2 inches all the way around the next time I make it.
